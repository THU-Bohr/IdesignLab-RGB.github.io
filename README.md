#IdesignLab RGB-D dataset-
a comprehensive resource designed for training and evaluating the performance and understanding capability of mobile robots in dynamic scenes. Our research focuses on improving the perception and decision-making abilities of mobile robot systems to cope with complex moving targets and environmental changes in the real world.The dataset comprises real-world data collected from actual environments and simulated scene data generated through a virtual platform, with a primary focus on large-scale dynamic indoor scenes. It includes various data types such as RGB images, depth maps, 2D object detection bounding boxes, 3D object bounding boxes, semantic segmentation annotations, and camera poses. We provide detailed descriptions of the dataset's organization, the setup of the data acquisition platform, and the annotation methods employed. Additionally, we evaluate the dataset's performance on 2D/3D object detection, semantic segmentation, and robot relocalization tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the broad applicability of the IdesignLab RGB-D dataset in the field of mobile robotics. By sharing this dataset, we aim to foster the development of mobile robot technology and stimulate further research and innovation in this field.
